The Ultimate Team Builder

Description: FIFA Ultimate Team is a popular video game module from the FIFA video game
series. In this module, users can create their own Soccer teams of real life players and use
them in games against other usersâ€™ own teams. This program generates the best or worst team of
players based on the parameters inputted by the user. The category of parameters users can build
their team from are geography (the country, league or team in which a player plays), nationality,
physical attributes, and technical skills."""
